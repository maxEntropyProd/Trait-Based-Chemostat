# Trait-Based-Chemostat
Mathematica model for a trait-based model of bacterial growth in a chemostat. The distribution of a trait for maximum specific growth rate and substrate affinity is explored in a chemostat model, the results of which are compared to an experiment. This model supports the manuscript "Growth characteristics of natural microbial populations are skewed towards bacteria with low specific growth rates"
